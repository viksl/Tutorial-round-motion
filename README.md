# Tutorial-round-motion
Godot tutorial project showcasing character movement on round surface (3D, 2D) includes both GDScript and C#


**Instructions:**
1. Project includes both GDscript and C# script for character movement and those are: Player.gd and Player.cs.
2. Attach either depending on your needs and your Godot version (C# editor works with both GDScript and C# while standard editor version only with GDScript).
3. If you are using C# press the build button first - otherwise exported fields won't be available on the Player node.
4. Assign values (check the tutorial video if you want some default values to test).
5. currentBody(GDScript)/_currentBody(C#) should be the static body in the scene (the large sphere, you can't really miss it).
6. Play the project and use WASD + spacebar to move around.

*This is not an exhaustive character controller, feel free to adjust it as you see fit, this is suppsoed to server as one of the ways you can move character on a spherical/circular/or any other for that matter (check video tutorial for details on how) object.*
